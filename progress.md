### CITI / IRB training — PASSED
Completed the following UCF CITI **Stage 1 – Basic Courses**, all passed **18-Aug-2026**:
- **IRB Protocol Review**
- **Research and HIPAA Privacy Protections**
- **Researchers – Information Privacy & Security (IPS)**

### IRB packet (v2 branch)
- Filled the administrative fields across the IRB source docs and rebuilt the 8-document
  submission packet:
  - PI: **Dr. Roshan Venkatakrishnan** — roshan.venkatakrishnan@ucf.edu — **407-823-3957** —
    Computer Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science
  - Student investigator: **Pedro Poveda** — pe011248@ucf.edu
  - Lab rooms: **HEC 208, HEC 308, BYC 119** (UCF Main Campus)
  - Submission date: **2026-08-18**; compensation from **approved laboratory funds**
- Reused institutional facts (department, rooms, funding, minimal-risk precedent) from the
  **Study 9491** lab reference packet (Mehrab Islam, same PI).
- Removed the "DRAFT — NOT FOR SUBMISSION" banner from all 8 generated documents
  (updated `build-irb-packet.py` + `verify-irb-packet.py`).
- Huron study created: **STUDY00009581**.

### Still open
- **UCF determinations** (their call): risk level, injury-language wording, clinical-trial
  classification, conflict-of-interest disclosure, Certificate of Confidentiality.
- **Post-approval fills**: IRB study number on recruitment materials, exact calendar dates.
- **Protocol vs. implementation gap**: the Unity build is still the 14-round bookshelf
  prototype and does not yet implement the planned 8-plane / 4-block / Williams design.
